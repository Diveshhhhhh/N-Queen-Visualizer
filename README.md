# N Queen Visualizer

This project is an interactive visualizer for the N Queen problem, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The N Queen problem is a classic combinatorial problem in which the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This visualizer allows users to see the Backtracking algorithm in action and understand how the problem is solved.
